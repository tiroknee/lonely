# Sounds Directory

> **Note**: This directory is empty by default. The asciitorium library includes starter assets in `node_modules/asciitorium/public/art/sounds/` that are automatically available without copying. See the main [art/README.md](../README.md) for details on using and customizing library assets.

This directory contains audio assets in MP3 format used throughout the
application.

## Usage

Sound files can be referenced in material definitions, sprite definitions, or
played programmatically through the application's audio system.
