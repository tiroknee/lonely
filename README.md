# 🕯️ Lonely Lantern

> _When heroes fall, legends rise._

An ASCII game where you play as a bard accompanying heroes into cursed dungeons. Control both the hero's movement and your musical support in real-time dual-handed gameplay.

## About

You stand at the edge of a cursed valley, lute in hand. Heroes come seeking glory in the depths. Your job? Follow them in, keep them alive with your music, and survive to tell the tale.

**Dual-control gameplay** — Your left hand guides the hero (WASD/F), your right hand plays protective melodies (HJKL+Shift). Coordination and timing separate triumph from tragedy.

Built with [Asciitorium](https://github.com/okwolf/asciitorium) and TypeScript.
